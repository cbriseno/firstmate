# tests/fm-delivery-fallback.test.sh - bin/fm-delivery-fallback.sh switches a
# ship already under way to a less rigorous delivery path when a captain rule
# made its selected path unavailable, without a captain question.
# Driven through the real executable, the real bin/fm-brief.sh scaffold, and
# the real bin/fm-send.sh inbox plane over a stubbed tmux, it pins:
#   1. no-mistakes -> direct-PR re-renders the brief's Definition of done and
#      rule 1, records mode= and fallback_from= while keeping yolo= and upstream
#      consent, and durably steers the worker with the full new contract.
#   2. --resolve-key closes the worker's open delivery-fallback blocker.
#   3. A re-run resends the steer without changing the brief or the record.
#   4. direct-PR -> local-only drops upstream consent, which local-only never
#      uses, from both the contract and the record.
#   5. A switch that adds rigor, a forge-bound task falling back to local-only,
#      and a non-ship task are refused with nothing changed and nothing sent.
