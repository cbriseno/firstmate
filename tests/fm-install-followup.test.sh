# tests/fm-install-followup.test.sh - bin/fm-install-followup.sh carries a
# captain's request from a project into the linked local installation its
# registry entry names (install=<project>). tests/fm-backlog-atomicity.test.sh
# pins the dispatch and teardown halves through the real spawn and teardown;
# this file pins what those callers do not reach:
#   1. brief scaffolds the follow-up through the real bin/fm-brief.sh with both
#      Task subsections filled - the original captain intent verbatim, where it
#      landed, and the integration spec - in the installation's registered mode,
#      and prints the spawn command with that installation's yolo.
#   2. brief refuses a registered no-mistakes-prod-only installation without
#      --mode, because that surface classification belongs to intake.
#   3. landed --discarded says the follow-up has nothing new to bring.
#   4. A hand-edited backlog is handed the add command instead of a filed row.
#   5. An unlinked project is a silent no-op for every subcommand.
