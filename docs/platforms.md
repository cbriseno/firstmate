# Platform setup

Firstmate uses Bash, Unix process groups, filesystem permissions and a terminal runtime.
Use Linux or macOS directly, or a Linux distribution inside WSL2 on Windows.
Native PowerShell, Git Bash/MSYS, Cygwin and WSL1 are not validated Firstmate runtimes; startup, bootstrap and dispatch refuse them before changing operational state.
A native Windows harness or a tmux-compatible executable does not establish compatible Firstmate process ownership, locking or supervision.
Other Unix kernels are not currently accepted.

## Prepare the runtime

Install Git, Bash, Python 3.9 or newer, Perl and jq with your platform's package manager.
On Linux and WSL2, use GNU Coreutils `mkdir`, `timeout` and `cat` on the runtime's `PATH`.
The doctor reports other implementations as unsupported: uutils 0.10.0 can return success to competing directory-lock claimants, has different interrupt-timeout behavior, and can report a successful write with stdout closed.
The upstream [mkdir correction](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/commit/bf423f388d543b9180db6b7283d82b301f138913) does not establish compatibility for the rest of that toolchain.
Ubuntu 24.04 provides the GNU route used by Linux CI; on Ubuntu 26.04, select the GNU utilities using [Ubuntu's documented alternatives](https://github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-release-notes/blob/main/docs/26.04/summary-for-lts-users.md#rust-coreutils) before running Firstmate.
macOS continues to use its BSD utilities and the existing timeout fallback.
The [toolchain configuration](configuration.md#toolchain) owns the additional agent, Node, forge and fleet tools and their version requirements.
Choose a supported primary harness and runtime; [tmux](tmux-backend.md) is the reference route.
The [upstream tmux installation guide](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Installing) covers Linux distributions and macOS package managers.
On macOS, stock Bash 3.2 is supported by the existing compatibility lane; install Python and the selected backend separately.
Use the backend's own guide for platform constraints, especially macOS-only cmux.

On Windows, install WSL2 and a Linux distribution using [Microsoft's WSL installation instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
Confirm the distribution uses version 2 with `wsl --list --verbose` in PowerShell, then run setup, Git, the primary harness, tools and backend inside that distribution.
Keep the checkout and operational home in the Linux filesystem, following [Microsoft's filesystem guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/filesystems).
Do not mix Windows `.exe` tools, Windows credential paths or drive-mounted operational state into the Linux runtime.
The WSL2 route is based on its Linux environment; it is not a claim of a completed Firstmate Windows acceptance run.

Clone the intended public repository, then run this from its root:

```sh
bash bin/fm-doctor.sh --backend tmux
```

The doctor is read-only and performs no network, installs, logins, service lifecycle actions or agent prompts.
It reports prerequisites, not a successful live dispatch or authentication result.
Startup's existing bootstrap remains responsible for installed tool versions and authentication checks.
Resolve reported missing dependencies before launching a primary harness using the [configuration guide](configuration.md).
Set a Git identity with `git config --global user.name` and `user.email`, because workers commit under it; without one they choose an author themselves.

## Launch the primary

Start the primary harness from the clone's root directory; the clone is the operational home unless `FM_HOME` names another.
Its tracked project hooks run the session-start digest and own supervision, so they must be allowed to run.

- **Claude Code:** run `claude` and answer its workspace trust prompt with "Yes, I trust this folder" once per clone.
  The digest runs before the first turn, and a Stop hook wakes the idle session when a worker reports, so the captain does not have to nudge it.
- **Codex:** run `codex`, trust the folder, then choose "Trust all and continue" when Codex reports that the project's hooks need review; with untrusted hooks no Firstmate hook runs.
  The digest runs when the first prompt opens the session.
  Codex supervision is foreground: while work is under way the primary keeps its turn open and runs bounded watcher checkpoints, so worker results, decisions and landing asks arrive without a nudge.
  After a Codex turn ends, later worker events wait in the durable queue until the next message; the experimental [native Codex supervision](configuration.md#codex-native-supervision) opt-in is the only post-turn wake path and needs its own live acceptance.

The primary runs shell commands that drive the terminal backend, create Git worktrees outside the clone, and fetch from remotes, so choose its permission or approval posture with that in mind.
Workers launch with the unattended postures described in the [configuration guide](configuration.md#claude-permission-mode-configclaude-permission-mode).
Then tell the first mate which project to add, by URL or local path, and what to do.

## Private operational home and integrations

The existing [operational-home layout](configuration.md#operational-home-layout-and-state) keeps machine choices in `FM_HOME`, separate from tracked code.
When a caller invokes helpers from a separate code tree, pass that tree using the existing `FM_ROOT_OVERRIDE` and the private home explicitly using `FM_HOME`.
Select the helper executable from the code tree itself; an environment variable cannot relocate the executable already invoked.
Retain legacy home-local `bin/` discovery for integrations that previously used colocated code and state.
Do not put absolute machine paths, login material, project inventories, notification destinations or service addresses in tracked files.

The Deck web kanban can consume the existing snapshot and guarded action interfaces without changing their schemas.
Localhost is sufficient for public web operation; private remote access and network exposure belong to the operator's separate configuration.
Firstmate does not provision a web server or network exposure through the doctor or exporter.

Native Codex supervision is an optional Linux-only capability with exact process and executable identity checks.
The doctor does not enable it, attest a binding, install hooks or relax those checks on another platform.
Follow the [native Codex configuration contract](configuration.md#codex-native-supervision) and its current verification evidence before opting in.

## Verification limits

A successful Linux test is not macOS or Windows evidence.
The platform regressions simulate kernel classification and early refusal only; they do not certify a host or a backend.
Use the existing [runtime verification entry points](verification/runtime-backends.md) and an isolated dispatch on each actual target machine before relying on its supervision.
Exporting a public copy and carrying later improvements across the private/public boundary are covered by [public export](public-export.md).
