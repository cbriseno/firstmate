#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Carry a captain's request from a project into its linked local installation.
# A project opts in with the registry token install=<project>
# (bin/fm-project-mode.sh owns the token, its --install query, and its
# refusals): work that lands there is finished for the captain only once it
# also reaches <project>, for example a public fork whose changes must reach the
# captain's private Firstmate home or plugin runtime. This script is the single
# owner of what that link does; the existing spawn, merge, and teardown paths
# call it rather than carrying a second copy.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-install-followup.sh ensure <task-id> <project-name>
#   fm-install-followup.sh landed <task-id> <project-name> [--discarded]
#   fm-install-followup.sh brief <task-id> <project-name> [--mode <no-mistakes|direct-PR|local-only>]
#
# The follow-up is an ordinary backlog work item, `<task-id>-install`, of kind
# ship and repo <project>, Queued and blocked by <task-id> itself. The
# dependency is the whole mechanism: it is filed when the original is
# dispatched, so it is visible from the start and cannot be lost between the
# landing and a later turn, and the original's own close in bin/fm-teardown.sh
# is what clears it, so landing makes it dispatchable with no new state, hold,
# or watcher.
#
# ensure files that item when <project-name> registers a link and is a no-op
# otherwise; tasks-axi `add` is idempotent, so a repeat keeps the existing row.
# bin/fm-spawn.sh calls it on every fresh ship dispatch, before any endpoint
# or local copy exists, and refuses the dispatch when it fails, because a
# dispatched task whose follow-up was never filed is exactly the dropped
# installation this exists to prevent. A home whose backlog is edited by hand
# (bin/fm-backlog-transition-lib.sh's gate does not apply) gets the exact add
# command to run instead. Exit 0 filed or not linked, 1 the backlog refused,
# 2 usage, 3 the registry refused the link.
#
# landed is bin/fm-teardown.sh's call after a ship's backlog close lands. It
# re-runs ensure, so work dispatched before this script existed is covered
# too, and then prints the one next action: the follow-up is ready, and the
# request is not finished until it lands in the installation. That dispatch is
# firstmate's to perform in the same turn, never a question for the captain.
# With --discarded (a --force teardown, which lands nothing) it instead says
# the follow-up has nothing new to bring. It never fails a teardown that
# already completed: a failure prints the manual command to stderr and exits 1.
#
# brief scaffolds data/<task-id>-install/brief.md through bin/fm-brief.sh and
# fills both Task subsections, so the dispatch costs firstmate no drafting:
# `## Captain's intent` is the original brief's subsection verbatim plus one
# sentence naming where it landed and that it must now work in the
# installation, and `## Firstmate spec` is the fixed integration instruction
# below. The mode is the installation's registered flat mode, or --mode; a
# registered no-mistakes-prod-only policy needs --mode, because that surface
# classification is firstmate's at intake (project-management). It prints the
# bin/fm-spawn.sh command to run next with the installation's registered yolo,
# leaving the dispatch profile to the ordinary intake rule.
