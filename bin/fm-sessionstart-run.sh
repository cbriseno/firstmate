#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Session-open entry point for harnesses that RUN the digest instead of asking
# the agent to. It is the one command those harnesses' session-open adapters
# invoke, and it decides, from the session-open source, whether this open needs
# the full digest, a context re-emit, or nothing at all.
#
# Why running beats nudging: bin/fm-sessionstart-nudge.sh can only ASK the agent
# to take the helm, and an agent can defer that, including when a first-command
# skill has its own read-only path. When the native adapter injects this
# command's stdout into model context, running the digest here removes that
# discretion - the helm is taken before the model's first turn, whatever the
# first turn is.
#
# Usage: fm-sessionstart-run.sh [--source <source>] [--pi-prerequisite]
#   --source  The harness's own session-open source. When omitted, the source is
#             read from a Claude/Codex-shaped JSON hook payload on stdin
#             (the `source` field). An unreadable or unrecognized source is
#             treated as `startup`, because taking the helm redundantly is
#             cheap and idempotent while not taking it is the whole bug.
#   --pi-prerequisite
#             Internal Pi extension mode. An intentional gate/scope stand-down
#             exits 3 so provider preflight can distinguish it from an eligible
#             native attempt that settled without output. Every ordinary hook
#             invocation retains the always-zero compatibility contract below.
#
# Source routing (see docs/sessionstart-nudge.md for the per-harness names):
#   startup, new            full digest - this process has not taken the helm
#   clear, compact          `--reemit` digest only when this lock owner recorded
#                           a completed full startup; otherwise a full digest,
#                           so a startup killed mid-sweep is finished first
#   resume, reload, fork    delegate to the nudge wrapper. Prior context is
#                           restored on these, so re-running is redundant when
#                           this process still holds the lock (the nudge stays
#                           silent) and a plain instruction is enough when a new
#                           process resumed an old session (the nudge fires).
#
# Every ordinary transport path exits 0, exactly like the nudge wrapper: a
# Claude SessionStart exit 2 blocks session initialization, so a failed session
# start must reach the agent as digest text it can act on, never as a refusal to
# open the session. The internal Pi prerequisite's silent exit 3 never reaches a
# harness hook; it only distinguishes intentional ineligibility before provider
# preflight. A lock another live session holds and a truncated digest are
# reported inside the digest, while broken GitHub auth arrives through the
# deferred network result inline or as a wake, for exactly that reason.
# A fresh clone has no gitignored state dir yet; a root that otherwise
# qualifies as primary gets one created here before the scope check runs, so
# the first session takes the helm without a manual `mkdir state`.
#
# HOOK BUDGET. A hook harness discards everything a hook printed when it kills
# the hook at its registered timeout (180s for Claude, Codex, and Cursor), so a
# digest that is still running then is lost without a word. The digest's own
# FM_SESSION_START_TIMEOUT bound does not close that gap alone: a nested bounded
# call runs in a process group of its own, survives the digest's group kill,
# and keeps the hook's stdout open until its own bound expires, while a loaded
# host can spend the remaining margin before the digest even starts.
# So this wrapper runs bin/fm-session-start.sh under FM_SESSION_START_HOOK_BUDGET
# (default 150s, which must stay below every registered hook timeout) with its
# stdout and stderr captured to private files, then prints them itself. No
# descendant ever holds the harness's pipe, and whatever the digest emitted
# before the budget is still delivered. The budget's deadline also reaches
# bin/fm-session-start.sh as FM_SESSION_START_DEADLINE, which caps the digest's
# own bound to fit inside it, so on a slow host that script's stage-naming
# STARTUP TRUNCATED banner normally reports first, and this budget stays the
# backstop for a start that cannot even reach its own bound. A run the budget
# stops, or one that exits nonzero for any other reason, ends with a SESSION
# START INCOMPLETE notice telling the agent to run bin/fm-session-start.sh, so
# an overrun is never silent. bin/fm-session-start.sh stays the owner of what
# runs and in what order.
